   <h1>Luigis Mansion</h1>
   <h4>General Informations</h4>
   <p>Now we come to a completely different topic. A topic which is about video games. <br>In this case: Luigis Mansion 3</p>

   <p>What is Luigis Mansion 3? Luigis Mansion 3 is a game about the famous video game character Luigi from the Super Mario Bros Series.</p>
   <p>As you've probably already guessed, there are 3 different parts of the game, but in the following i will first describe the concept of the game<br>and after this i will describe the third part more detailed.</p>
    <h4>The game concept</h4>
    <p>How does this game work?</p>
    <p>Basically, you are a ghost Hunter and you play as Luigi. With your ghosthunter tool, called Schreckweg-Flu in german, you hunt different<br> ghosts and try too free your Friends Mario Peach and Toad from the Evil Ghost king Buu-Huu.</p>
    <p>The location is alway a haunted place like a Big house or a Hotel.</p>
    <h2>The Third Part</h2>
    <h4>The Story</h4>
    <p>Luigi, his brother Mario, her Friend Peach and some Toads, won a vacation in a really big Hotel.</p>
    <p>After getting there and checking in everybody went to his own room to slepp a bit after the long trip.
    <br>But in the night Luigi gets waken up by a scream of peach. He is really scared and walks out of his room to inspect the hallway
    <br>and maybe find out what is happening. The location also changed from a golden shining hotel to a really dark and dirty hotel where you dont want to spent your time.
    <br>After Luigi inspected all the rooms of his fellow friends, he gets confronted with King Buu-Huu, who trapped his friends in paintings. Shortly before he can catch Luigi,
    <br>can escape and rescues his self in a Laundry slide. This Laundry slide gets him directly into the basement where The game starts. This is the story so far, the action goes
    <br>on with Luigi collecting his ghost hunting tools and trying to rescue his friends.</p>
