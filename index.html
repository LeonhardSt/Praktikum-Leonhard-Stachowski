    <h2>Different types of trees</h2>
    <p>Trees come in an astonishing variety, each with its unique characteristics and adaptations. Let’s explore some of the diverse types of trees that adorn our landscapes:</p>
    <p>Deciduous Trees: These trees, such as oaks, maples, and birches, are known for their seasonal foliage changes. They shed their leaves in autumn, revealing intricate<br>
      branch patterns against the winter sky, and burst into a riot of colors in the spring.</p>
    <p>Coniferous Trees: Pines, spruces, and firs fall into this category. They bear cones and have needles that are well-adapted to cold climates. Their evergreen nature<br>
      provides year-round color and life to our surroundings.</p>
    <p>Tropical Trees: The rainforests are home to a plethora of tree species like the kapok and the rubber tree. These giants often have broad leaves and are crucial for the<br>
      biodiversity of their ecosystems.</p>
    <p>Fruit Trees: Apple, cherry, and peach trees not only provide delightful blossoms but also bear fruits that are essential for both wildlife and human consumption.</p>
    <p>Ornamental Trees: Sought after for their aesthetic appeal, species like the Japanese maple or the flowering dogwood offer stunning visual displays with their unique leaves<br>
      and beautiful flowers.</p>
    <p>Each type of tree plays a vital role in its habitat, from providing oxygen and shelter to stabilizing soil and supporting wildlife. They are truly the pillars of the plant kingdom.</p>
